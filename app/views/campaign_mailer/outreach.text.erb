Hi *|FNAME|*,
Thank you for supporting New Living, a mission-driven Certified Benefit Corporation that has made a legal commitment to measure success on a social, environmental and economic level.

Our goal is to spread values-based shopping in Houston and beyond. We don’t invest in advertising because we rely heavily on our customers sharing with their friends the reasons they shop at New Living. As one of our supporters, we’d like to offer you a thank-you for helping to spread the word.

If you help at least one of your friends become a New Living Customer, we’ll give you a $50 Whole Foods gift card. We’re also offering each of the friends you tell a free premium indoor plant just for learning more.  If at least one of your friends purchases a listed item, then everyone wins: they get a great socially responsible product and free gift from New Living, you get a Whole Foods gift card, and we all help spread values-based shopping in Houston.

To participate:

1) Log onto our word-of-mouth platform here: newliving.weaveenergy.com
2) Select the product you’d like to refer (options range from air filters to solar panels).
3) Select a friend who would appreciate that product, personalize a message, enter their email address, and click send.
4) Answer any questions your friends have and claim your gift cards as they make purchases.

Thank you again for your support. Please feel free to get in touch if you have any questions at newliving@weaveenergy.com (mailto:newliving@weaveenergy.com)
All best,
The New Living Team

Happy 4th of July from the New Living Team!
